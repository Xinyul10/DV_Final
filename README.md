## Introduction
Introduction of the whole and navigation above
The above navigation table of contents shows the general framework and construction of my work. It is dividied into 4 parts: Introduction and Preparation part, Trim part, Visualization part and Conclusion part. In the Introduction and Preparation part, there are the introduction of the project, instrcutions to scan this notebook, some usual imports and check the dataset we need to use again. During the Trim part, I do some clean and edit to better prepare for the later visualization, specially here, I solve the two probelm: Unified time type and missing category name (only id). Then, the most important part of the whol project is visualization part, which shows interactive visualization to help users better discover the dataset. And the last conclusion part includes some conclusions and feelings I get throughout the proccess.
